wirease iMproved

# About
This program was supposed to be the improved version of Wirease, a file generating program that I made and didn't make it to the actual release,
and this is where the name "Wirease iMproved" came from.
What this program basically does is to generate a filesystem based on a simple script called "wem script".
the intention of this program is:
- Automate the process of manually creating a bunch of files
- Reduce typos and increase the stability
- Increase the time effeciency
