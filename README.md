wirease iMproved

# About
<p>
This program was supposed to be the improved version of Wirease, a file generating program that I made and didn't make it to the actual release,
and this is where the name "Wirease iMproved" came from.
What this program basically does is to generate a filesystem based on a simple script called "wem script".
the intention of this program is:
</p>
- Automate the process of manually creating a bunch of files
- Reduce typos and increase the stability
- Increase the time effeciency

# How to use it
1. To create a filesystem named *my_note* using a wem script *note_tmpl*
```
$ wem create note my_note
```
- Further more:
<p>To specify the asset file, use -s/--source option</p>
```
$ wem create note my_note -s your_asset_folder
```
